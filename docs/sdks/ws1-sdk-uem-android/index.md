The Workspace ONE SDK (formerly known as AirWatch SDK) code library for Google Android devices can be used to enable additional app config and security capabilities that may not yet be available natively as part of the AppConfig Community. Certain use cases such as granular analytics can be provided through a deeper integration with the SDK. The Workspace ONE SDK for Android is also a good choice in deployment scenarios where a MDM profile installation on the device is not possible.

## Agreement
Before downloading, installing or using the VMware Workspace ONE SDK you must:
* Review the VMware Workspace ONE Software Development Kit License Agreement. By downloading, installing, or using the VMware Workspace ONE SDK you agree to these license terms. If you disagree with any of the terms, then do not use the software.
* Review the VMware Privacy Notice and the Workspace ONE UEM Privacy Disclosure.

## Latest Software
The Workspace ONE SDK for Android is distributed through a public Maven repository. Follow the instructions in the guides below to integrate the latest software. The SDK can instead be downloaded from the My Workspace ONE portal, if you have a My VMware username and password. The Maven repository is the recommended integration method.
